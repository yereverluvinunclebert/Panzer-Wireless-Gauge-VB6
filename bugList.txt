' more information signal noise &c
WLAN_BSS_ENTRY structure has another field called uLinkQuality that returns a value from 0 to 100 and indicates the link quality.  
I understand this to be a rough measurement of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)

Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) value. Smaller negative numbers represent a cleaner/stronger signal. As close to zero as you can get.


Depending on your OS and application, WiFi signal strength is represented either as quality in percentage, or an RSSI value in dBm, i.e. -70db. 
RSSI is usually expressed in decibels relative to a milliwat (dBm) from zero to -120dBm and the closer it is to zero, the stronger the signal is. 
RSSI level less than -80dBm may not be usable, depending on noise.

Noise (dBm) in wireless communications is a combination of all unwanted interfering signal sources, such as crosstalk, radio frequency interference, 
distortion, etc. This value is measured in decibels from zero to -120. The closer this value is to -120, the better, because that means there is 
little to no interference. Typical environments range between -100dBm and -80dBm.

While there is no simple precise solution that is used universally, we will try to explain the approximate correlation between signal (RSSI) 
and quality (percentage).

Generally,
dBm >= -50 dBm = 100% quality
dBm <= -100 dBm = 0% quality

For RSSI signal between -50dBm and -100dBm,
quality ~= 2* (dBm + 100)
RSSI ~= (percentage / 2) - 100

For example:
High quality: 90% ~= -55dBm
Medium quality: 50% ~= -75dBm
Low quality: 30% ~= -85dBm
Unusable quality: 8% ~= -96dBm

' RC BUGS & LIMITATIONS
' =====================

' tooltips also resize when the whole thing is resized, code received from Olaf tested - resizing results in missing text and blank tooltips, using non-standard font centurion light
' RC6 needs a static tooltip option.
